    <p>If, like me, you have not done any frontend development for quite some time, chances are you need to refresh your basics.</p>
    <p>I have done quite a bit of JSP in 2003 (back in the day that was cool), and I can tell you html, javascript and,especially, CSS have changed a lot,
        so if your experience is as old as mine, (or better yet, if you have no experience) just forget everything you have learned and continue reading,
        it's a completely new ball game now...
