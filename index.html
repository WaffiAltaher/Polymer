    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>If, like me, you have not done any frontend development for quite some time, chances are you need to refresh your basics.</p>
      <p>I have done quite a bit of JSP in 2003 (back in the day that was cool), and I can tell you html, javascript and,especially, CSS have changed a lot, 
      so if your experience is as old as mine, (or better yet, if you have no experience) just forget everything you have learned and continue reading, 
      it's a completely new ball game now...

					  <h3>Must reads</h3>
					  <p>A very good start for you basics is <a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></p>
					  <p>Below you can find links to some must-read tutorials, this will give you the needed background...</p>

      <h3><b>The Basics - Part 2</b></h3>
      <h5>Some stuff you can read here, no links...</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>While the tutorials should make you feel confident about you background knowledge, if you open any real-world web project, you will 
		face a lot other development tools that are used: gulp, grunt, npm, nodeJS, bower, and the list goes on
      </p>
      <p>It will take you around 2-3 years to go through the website of each tool, learn it and practice a bit with it, and by the time you are done, chances are those tool are now outdated and there are new <i>cooler</i> tool in the market, therefore, here you can read a super-condensed dumbed down inaccurate simplification of them to get you started</p>

					  class="w3-button w3-display-topright">&times;</span>
					  <div class="w3-card w3-margin-top">
					  <h3>NodeJS</h3>
					  <h4>What is it?</h4>
					  <p>NodeJS is a runtime for Javascript. This means it is used to run JavaScript on the server side, so you can create backend applications, or REST APIs using Javascript.</p>
					  <h4>So why do I need it in a <i>front end</i> project</h4>
					  <p>Any decent site will consist of more than just static data, this means that chances are your web app will be using some form of API to retrieve data from your backend. 
					  Now you still wont need NodeJS for that, but in order to be able to test your application, you will either need to depend on your backend appliction(s), or you need to be able to quickly spin a server
					  that can serve your web application and stub/mock your APIs. This is were NodeJS comes into play.</p>	
					  <h3>NPM</h3>
					  <p>NPM for NodeJS is like maven for Java development, it is the package manager that allowes you to define the models that your server side code needs and it will download it automaticaly for you.</p>
					  <p>examples of stuff that you will need to download via npm are bower, karma, protractor, http-server, etc</p>
					  <p><i>*if you dont know what are those, dont worry, some of them are mentioned below, some will be explained later on</i></p><i></i>
					  </div>
					  
					  <div class="w3-card">	
					  <h3>Bower</h3>
					  <p>Again, bower is like the maven of Javascript. So how is it different than <i>npm</i>?</p>
					  <p><i>npm</i> is for components that you will need in the server side that you will start while you are <i><b>testing</b></i> your application, 
					  while <i>bower</i> is used for dependencies that you wanna use in the browser, stuff like you polymer library, your css libraries and the likes.</p>
					  </div>
					  
					  <div class="w3-card">
					  <h3>Grunt</h3>
					  <p><i>Grunt</i> is a task runner that you use it to automated repeated task, kind of a miniture Jenkins. For example, every time you want to execute all your tests, then you have to issue some commands to start your local nodeJS http server,
					  startup a test suite and maybe upload the test report somewhere, you can configure a grunt job to do all of this for you.</p>
					  <p>Another example is if you use a typed javascript variation, then everytime before you run your app you must <i>compile</i> your typescript into javascript. </p>

									<h4><a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-web-components-and-polymer-tutorial/">Sitepoint Tutorial</a></h4>
									<p>This one-page simple tutorial is quite old (<span class="w3-tag">Polymer 0.3.4</span>), but
										the concepts there are explained nicely, use it for understanding the concepts rather than learning exact syntax  </p>
									<p>Also worth noting is that the tutorial explains the /deep/ and ::shadow selectors, which are now deprecated, also
										Vulcanize is explained in the tutorial, and is mentioned in the Polymer 1 documentation, but not Polymer 2</p>

									<h4><a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/">Google Web Fundamentals</a></h4>
									<p>Strictly speaking, this is not Polymer specific documentation, this is Google's way of explaining all the new fundamental concepts that
									<span class="w3-tag">Polymer</span> is based upon</p>
									<p>This might be too much to read in one go, bet is to keep it as a reference that you can refer to every time you come across a new concept</p>


									<h4><a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview">Polymer Official Docs</a></h4>
									<p>Official <span class="w3-tag">Polymer</span> Docs, obviously a must read, however bear in mind that it is not really
										well documented, so this is not a one stop shop for all your needs, unfortunately. </p>
									<p>You should also know that Polymer changed a lot between Polymer 1 and Polymer 2, so if you need to work on Polymer 1 then you should read <b>both</b>
									versions documentation</p>
