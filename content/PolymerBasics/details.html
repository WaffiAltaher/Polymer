    <h4><a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-web-components-and-polymer-tutorial/">Sitepoint Tutorial</a></h4>
    <p>This one-page simple tutorial is quite old (<span class="w3-tag">Polymer 0.3.4</span>), but
        the concepts there are explained nicely, use it for understanding the concepts rather than learning exact syntax  </p>
    <p>Also worth noting is that the tutorial explains the /deep/ and ::shadow selectors, which are now deprecated, also
        Vulcanize is explained in the tutorial, and is mentioned in the Polymer 1 documentation, but not Polymer 2</p>

    <h4><a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/">Google Web Fundamentals</a></h4>
    <p>Strictly speaking, this is not Polymer specific documentation, this is Google's way of explaining all the new fundamental concepts that
        <span class="w3-tag">Polymer</span> is based upon</p>
    <p>This might be too much to read in one go, bet is to keep it as a reference that you can refer to every time you come across a new concept</p>


    <h4><a class="w3-hover-text-blue" href="https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview">Polymer Official Docs</a></h4>
    <p>Official <span class="w3-tag">Polymer</span> Docs, obviously a must read, however bear in mind that it is not really
        well documented, so this is not a one stop shop for all your needs, unfortunately. </p>
    <p>You should also know that Polymer changed a lot between Polymer 1 and Polymer 2, so if you need to work on Polymer 1 then you should read <b>both</b>
        versions documentation</p>
